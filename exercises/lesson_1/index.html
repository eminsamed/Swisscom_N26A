    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Emin Samed YILMAZ. I was born in 1988 in Ankara/Turkey. I completed my undergraduate
        education in 2011, graduating from Selcuk University, Department of Geological Engineering. After working
        as an administrative assistant in a private employment office, I worked as an expert four years in the
        agriculture and rural development support institution Aydin coordination unit. I had to leave the job due to
        political reasons and then I worked as a salesperson in a carpet store for two years. Then I came to Switzerland
        and I have been living in the canton of Lucerne since September 2018. In order to improve my communication
        skills in the canton I live in, I worked for two years as a courier in a pizzeria. I am currently continuing
        my IT education with HiCoders.
